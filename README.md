# ðŸŒ± Smart Water Irrigation System using Arduino Uno



The **Smart Water Irrigation System** is an automated solution designed to optimize water usage in agriculture and gardening. Using **Arduino Uno**, **soil moisture sensors**, and **relay modules**, the system monitors soil conditions in real time and automatically activates water pumps when moisture levels fall below a predefined threshold. This helps save water, reduces manual effort, and ensures plants receive adequate irrigation.



## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Automate irrigation based on real-time soil moisture data.
* Minimize water wastage through smart monitoring.
* Support sustainable farming and gardening practices.
* Provide a low-cost, scalable solution for farmers and households.
